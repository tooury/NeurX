### Analysis of Transient Analysis Results for NeurX Hybrid System v0.04

**Overview:**
The transient analysis plot and data for the NeurX hybrid system v0.04 show the voltage responses of components (c1, c3, c4) over time. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of the improvements and remaining issues based on the latest data.

### Key Observations:

1. **Voltage Stability:**
   - The voltage reaches the expected 1.8V level relatively quickly and maintains this level more consistently than in previous versions.
   - There are fewer spikes compared to earlier versions, indicating that the added decoupling capacitors and RC filters have helped reduce noise and stabilize the voltages.

2. **Voltage Spikes:**
   - While the spikes have been reduced, they are still present, particularly in the c4 line. This suggests further optimization is required to completely eliminate these transients.
   
3. **Periodic Voltage Changes:**
   - The periodic voltage changes, especially in c3 and c4, show a pattern that might be inherent to the switching operations of the memristors and spintronic elements.

### Recommendations for Further Improvement:

1. **Increase Decoupling Capacitance:**
   - Add more decoupling capacitors or increase the capacitance values (e.g., use 100nF and 1uF in parallel) to further smooth out any remaining voltage spikes.
   
2. **Optimize RC Filter Values:**
   - Fine-tune the resistor and capacitor values in the RC filters to better attenuate the specific frequencies causing the spikes. For example, increase the capacitance values in the RC filters to provide better low-pass filtering.

3. **Use Ferrite Beads in Additional Locations:**
   - Add ferrite beads to more power supply lines and critical signal lines to further suppress high-frequency noise.

4. **Improve Ground Plane and Power Plane Layout:**
   - Ensure that the PCB design has a continuous and uninterrupted ground plane and power plane to minimize ground loops and reduce noise.

5. **Active Filtering:**
   - Consider adding active filters (using op-amps) for critical nodes to provide better noise suppression.

6. **Simulation and Testing:**
   - Continue detailed SPICE simulations focusing on the transient response and noise characteristics of the circuit.
   - Perform real-world testing using high-speed oscilloscopes to capture and analyze transient behavior.
