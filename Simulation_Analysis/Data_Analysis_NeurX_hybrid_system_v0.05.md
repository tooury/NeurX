### Analysis of Transient Analysis Results for NeurX Hybrid System v0.05

**Overview:**
The transient analysis plot and data for the NeurX hybrid system v0.05 show voltage responses of components (c1, c3, c4) over time. Based on the observations, it appears that the changes made in v0.05 have not significantly altered the behavior compared to v0.04.

### Key Observations:

1. **Voltage Stability:**
   - The voltage reaches the expected 1.8V level and maintains this level consistently.
   - The decoupling capacitors and RC filters help stabilize the voltages, but the spikes are still present.

2. **Voltage Spikes:**
   - The voltage spikes, particularly in the c4 line, remain similar to previous versions. This suggests that the current noise reduction measures are not sufficient to eliminate these transients completely.

3. **Periodic Voltage Changes:**
   - The periodic voltage changes, especially in c3 and c4, continue to show a pattern that might be inherent to the switching operations of the memristors and spintronic elements.

### Recommendations for Further Improvement:

Given that the implemented measures have not completely resolved the issue, here are additional steps to consider:

1. **Check Component Values:**
   - Ensure that the component values for the decoupling capacitors and RC filters are appropriate for the frequencies involved. You might need higher capacitance or different resistor values.

2. **Improve Grounding:**
   - Ensure that the ground plane is continuous and has low impedance. Ground loops can introduce noise, so verify that the layout minimizes these loops.

3. **Increase Filtering Stages:**
   - Add more stages of filtering. For example, use a two-stage RC filter to provide better attenuation of high-frequency noise.

4. **Active Noise Cancellation:**
   - Consider using active noise cancellation techniques. Implement operational amplifiers configured as low-pass filters to actively reduce noise.

5. **Power Supply Decoupling:**
   - Add decoupling capacitors directly across the power supply pins of each critical component. Use a combination of capacitors (e.g., 100nF and 1uF) for different frequency ranges.
